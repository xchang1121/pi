# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the separate `keyProjectors` and `projectOutput` integration hooks with unified `projectionRules`; each lossless rule now owns its key relation, realized coverage proof, output reconstruction, and directed in-flight compatibility.
- Added required `ActionKey.schemaHash`; canonical keys now include execution class and validated input schema, preventing reuse after an in-session tool contract change.
- Removed the deprecated `ToolCache`, `maxCandidates`, `liveReadonly`, `minEmpiricalProbability`, and fixed single-step `mode` compatibility surfaces.
- Replaced inferred hit `savedMs`, `waitedMs`, `consumeOverheadMs`, `actorLeadMs`, and wall-clock speedup telemetry with monotonic `executionAheadMs`, `hitLatencyMs`, and diagnostic `attemptLeadMs`; execution overlap is capped by measured execution time, and matching leases no longer rewrite the timing owner of a deduplicated or cached job.
- Replaced copied plan/candidate statuses and split feedback callbacks with authoritative execution, prediction, and Actor-action settlements. Preparation hints no longer emit Actor prediction outcomes.
- Renamed ambiguous summary and inspection fields to `predictionRejectedAfterMatch`, `actorCandidateRejections`, `candidateTerminalCauses`, and `exclusiveCandidates`/`sharedCandidates`.
- Renamed the plan dependency and continuation signal from `actor_confirmed` to `actor_adopted`; a key match without a usable result no longer satisfies downstream work.
- Renamed source request horizons and `requestLifetime: "actor_action"` to decision-batch units; one Actor response may contain several parallel tool actions but advances prediction time only once.
- Split action identity from execution isolation. `ActionKey` no longer contains an execution class; adapters now resolve a `SpeculativeExecutionRoute` after K(a) materialization.
- Replaced the three tool groups (`resourceCached`, `sandbox`, and `predictionOnly`) with one prediction-enabled `tools` list. Legacy grouped settings are accepted only at the configuration migration boundary.
- Replaced the single sandbox option with ordered `executionWorlds`. A world supporting `runtime_sandbox` takes priority for every tool.
- Renamed prediction-only fallback telemetry to the general execution-blocked terminology.

### Added

- Added a speculative tool runtime with a host adapter, conservative action keys, resource validation, lifecycle events, and running or ready result reuse.
- Added canonical sandbox keys, an explicit sandbox host boundary, temporary `write`/`edit` execution, verified adoption, and opt-in bash process execution.
- Added private Git worktree snapshots, multi-file bash change capture, transactional world commit with rollback, and normalized cache/actual telemetry.
- Added a source-built Rust sandbox backend for Linux, macOS, and Windows, plus a versioned TypeScript broker, hash-verified packaged asset discovery, and fail-closed native process execution.
- Added an installable zero-modification Pi package that uses public lifecycle events, same-name tool overrides, public stock tool factories, and package-owned settings.
- Added a hierarchical Pi TUI for prediction, scheduling/cache, tool policy, and isolation, with configured, active, OCI, and native backend health reported separately.
- Added PatternAware online action-pattern learning with late-bound templates, future-gap leases, compact persistence, preparation hints, and utility-based resource scheduling.
- Added gap-weighted and decayed PatternAware inference, suffix backoff, collection mappers, retryable persisted analyzers, and multi-step frontiers.
- Added watcher-backed resource versions with exact-validation fallback, eager invalidation, byte-bounded per-session caches, pooled Git workspaces, and phase-level runtime metrics.
- Added an indexed per-session tool cache with atomic exact-key registration for cross-turn single-flight reuse.
- Added production Pi `read` range projection backed by structured realized-output coverage; grep and find remain exact-key-only.
- Added probation/protected speculative cache tiers: new results remain eviction-first until a successful actor hit promotes them, with bounded protected occupancy by entries and bytes.
- Added aggregate, input-free K(a) rejection counts to hit and miss telemetry.
- Added opt-in, adoption-gated Drafter continuation rounds: every confirmed prefix restores the configured independent-request width, shares the next-action budget with normal turn fanout, and admits fast responses without waiting for the batch; real-task ablation keeps the default depth at zero.
- Added a uniform route resolver with the priority `runtime_sandbox` → registered local isolation → Actor fallback.
- Added `resource_snapshot` as the local route for `read`, `grep`, and `find`, and `file_mutation` as the Git-worktree route for `write` and `edit`.
- Added an explicit `execution_blocked` plan state. Blocked predictions remain matchable without being confused with an impossible dependency.
- Added counterfactual timing for isolation-blocked matches using the same capped lead-time decomposition as adopted speculative work.

### Changed

- Read projection now reuses Pi coding-agent's public truncation contract and compact, in-memory coverage descriptors; projected single-flight reuse also requires explicit opt-in.
- World commit now serializes overlapping targets, uses staged atomic replacement, preserves file modes, and removes newly created directories during rollback.
- Drafter candidates now reuse exact and containing-read cache entries, deduplicate in-flight work, and replace stale resource entries before execution.
- Resource candidates now use probation/protected, value-aware eviction, and sandbox failures fall back without mutating the real workspace.
- Renamed read-only execution telemetry and settings to `resource_cached`/`resourceCached`.
- Pattern-aware and drafter predictions now deduplicate onto shared jobs, learned actions can be admitted immediately after authoritative results, and in-flight work is preempted by explicit utility and per-session cache budgets.
- PatternAware persistence now stores shared events once and references them from inference pools, preserving cross-process mapper evidence without repeatedly serializing tool payloads.
- PatternAware now learns executable tool payloads separately from K(a), retains multiple replayable argument mappings for one control context, and ranks each branch against all observed target-tool alternatives for that context.
- PatternAware now launches at the first quartile of its learned future-gap distribution while retaining the largest observed gap as the miss deadline, increasing useful lead time without widening the match window.
- Actor lookup cascades across authorization, freshness, execution, compatibility, projection, and world-commit failures before falling back to real execution.
- Compatible cache insertion is now atomic and directed, so a broader running read can single-flight a narrower request without ever coalescing in the unsafe reverse direction.
- Native sandbox protocol v3 now forwards the configured shell and requires an explicit process-isolation attestation; Linux recursively enforces read-only host mounts and readiness probes verify mount isolation.
- K(a) remains a uniform canonical action key; registered projection rules now require both a potential key relation and validated realized-output coverage before reconstructing an actor result.
- Drafter rounds now issue `candidateLimit` independent one-action requests concurrently, retain one low-temperature accuracy sample and diverse remaining samples, and rely on the existing K(a) relation to deduplicate execution.
- Drafter output budgets and arbitrary-count sampling are now configurable recommendations; configured request, rollout, and OCI worker counts no longer have hidden implementation caps.
- Drafter and PatternAware now emit only source-neutral actions; neither source can select an execution mechanism.
- Scheduler forecasts, resource arbitration, events, and cache snapshots derive isolation from the resolved route instead of K(a).
- In-flight and retained candidates are reused only when both K(a) compatibility and execution-route identity hold.
- The Pi TUI now exposes one tool policy and explains the runtime-sandbox, resource-snapshot, Git-worktree, and Actor-fallback boundary.
- Documentation and benchmark output now distinguish actual hidden latency from execution-blocked counterfactual potential.

### Fixed

- A newly captured exact-key result remains reachable when an older cache generation cannot be freshness-validated; bounded cache retention now owns both generations until one is proven stale or evicted.
- Continuation work can be reused immediately, but its prediction is anchored to the first causally eligible Actor decision; same-batch reuse is no longer misattributed as a future-step match.
- A continuation targeting the next Actor decision is no longer cancelled by a sibling tool call from the same parallel Actor response.
- Probation cache aging now advances after each Actor decision batch, after matching, so a completed multi-step prediction remains adoptable through its declared deadline even when a batch contains multiple tool calls.
- Query K(a) now preserves `read`'s omitted-limit semantics and rejects numeric views that Pi tools do not interpret as stable integer ranges.
- Tool error settlements are discarded before they can become reusable speculative cache entries.
- Package shutdown now releases owned workspace sandbox pools immediately instead of retaining Windows file watchers until the idle timeout.
- Native release manifests and smoke requests now use protocol v4 and verify the isolation attestation.
- Shell dispatch recognizes Windows-style executable paths even when protocol tests run on a non-Windows host.
- Missing Docker or Podman no longer produces a global sandbox warning when the native fallback is ready.
- Cache lookup, telemetry, and speculative cleanup failures can no longer replace an authoritative stock Pi tool result.
- Same-name tools registered during normal extension initialization now remain authoritative and are excluded from speculation regardless of load order; stock tool renderers are preserved for both TUI and HTML output.
- Execution-blocked predictions remain K(a)-matchable and no longer enter the dependency-impossible settlement path.
- Execution-world warm-up now prepares the same healthy backend selected by route resolution when an earlier registered capability is unavailable.

### Removed

- Removed the bundled OCI, native process, and Windows AppContainer backends and their setup paths. The package no longer installs or launches Docker/Podman and no longer mutates OS sandbox state.
- Removed process-backend routing and installation settings from the Pi extension; embedding runtimes can inject a runtime-wide `ExecutionWorld` instead.
